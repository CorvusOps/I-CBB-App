Note:

Due to relatively large size of newly added model, please download the initial models:
    - VGG19 model (vgg19-48C41H.tflite) in https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-8DxAOwUZX7i53JWW8AC40xH3ZDjo8hE/view?usp=sharing
    - ResNet50 (good-resnet.tflite) in https://drive.google.com/file/d/1--LYOHek9Efok3vDAbGLIfSwTeZUqYzg/view?usp=sharing

And import it as a Tensorflow lite model in Android Studio.
